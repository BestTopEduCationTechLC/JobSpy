## Supported Countries for Job Searching

### **LinkedIn**

LinkedIn searches globally & uses only the `location` parameter. 

### **ZipRecruiter**

ZipRecruiter searches for jobs in **US/Canada** & uses only the `location` parameter.

### **Indeed / Glassdoor**

Indeed & Glassdoor supports most countries, but the `country_indeed` parameter is required. Additionally, use the `location`
parameter to narrow down the location, e.g. city & state if necessary. 

You can specify the following countries when searching on Indeed (use the exact name, * indicates support for Glassdoor):

|                      |              |            |                |
|----------------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Argentina            | Australia*   | Austria*   | Bahrain        |
| Belgium*             | Brazil*      | Canada*    | Chile          |
| China                | Colombia     | Costa Rica | Czech Republic |
| Denmark              | Ecuador      | Egypt      | Finland        |
| France*              | Germany*     | Greece     | Hong Kong*     |
| Hungary              | India*       | Indonesia  | Ireland*       |
| Israel               | Italy*       | Japan      | Kuwait         |
| Luxembourg           | Malaysia     | Mexico*    | Morocco        |
| Netherlands*         | New Zealand* | Nigeria    | Norway         |
| Oman                 | Pakistan     | Panama     | Peru           |
| Philippines          | Poland       | Portugal   | Qatar          |
| Romania              | Saudi Arabia | Singapore* | South Africa   |
| South Korea          | Spain*       | Sweden     | Switzerland*   |
| Taiwan               | Thailand     | Turkey     | Ukraine        |
| United Arab Emirates | UK*          | USA*       | Uruguay        |
| Venezuela            | Vietnam*     |            |                |

### **Bayt**

Bayt only uses the search_term parameter currently and searches internationally



## Notes
* Indeed is the best scraper currently with no rate limiting.  
* All the job board endpoints are capped at around 1000 jobs on a given search.  
* LinkedIn is the most restrictive and usually rate limits around the 10th page with one ip. Proxies are a must basically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

---
**Q: Why is Indeed giving unrelated roles?**  
**A:** Indeed searches the description too.

- use - to remove words
- "" for exact match

Example of a good Indeed query

```py
search_term='"engineering intern" software summer (java OR python OR c++) 2025 -tax -marketing'
```

This searches the description/title and must include software, summer, 2025, one of the languages, engineering intern exactly, no tax, no marketing.

---

**Q: No results when using "google"?**  
**A:** You have to use super specific syntax. Search for google jobs on your browser and then whatever pops up in the google jobs search box after applying some filters is what you need to copy & paste into the google_search_term. 

---

**Q: Received a response code 429?**  
**A:** This indicates that you have been blocked by the job board site for sending too many requests. All of the job board sites are aggressive with blocking. We recommend:

- Wait some time between scrapes (site-dependent).
- Try using the proxies param to change your IP address.

## GitHub Pages frontend + weekly auto-scrape

This repo includes a self-contained static site under `docs/` you can serve with GitHub Pages,
plus a scheduled scraper that keeps its data fresh.

### Pages

- **`docs/index.html`** — the search page. Loads `docs/data/jobs.json` (the shared, publicly
  browsable dataset) and filters it live with a boolean search box (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`,
  `"exact phrases"`, `(grouping)`), plus an "Advanced scraper parameters" panel exposing
  JobSpy's full parameter set (sites, location, country, job type, remote-only, easy-apply,
  distance, results wanted, hours old). Clicking **Run New Search** starts a private scrape
  tied to your account — its results replace the view with only *your* results, never the
  shared dataset. Jobs can be selected via checkbox, saved to your personal page, or exported
  straight to PDF.
- **`docs/personal.html`** — "*{your username} personal interface test*": jobs you saved from
  the search page, your account's search history (each past run's own private results,
  re-viewable anytime), and an "Account" section to optionally add and confirm a real contact
  email. Supports removing jobs and exporting a selection (or everything) to PDF, with or
  without full descriptions.
- **`docs/contact.html`** — contact email and a placeholder legal-disclaimer section (content
  intentionally not filled in yet).
- **`index.html`** at the repo root just redirects into `docs/index.html`, in case GitHub Pages
  is configured to build from the branch root instead of `/docs`.

Login, saved jobs, private search results, and the scrape-trigger button all depend on
Supabase — see [`supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md) for the full setup (username/password
auth, the `saved_jobs`/`search_runs`/`search_results` tables + Row Level Security, the GitHub
repo secrets the workflow needs to write private results, and the Edge Function that triggers
scrapes). Until `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `docs/assets/app.js` are set to a real
project, the site still works for browsing/searching the shared already-scraped data, but
signing in, saving jobs, private searches, and "Run New Search" won't function.

### Boolean search vs. the scraper's own query syntax

The search box's `AND` / `OR` / `NOT` are resolved **client-side, before anything is sent to the
scraper** — never passed into JobSpy directly:

- Typing in the box filters `docs/data/jobs.json` using a real boolean parser (supports
  parentheses and quoted phrases).
- Clicking **Run New Search** takes that same text and rewrites it into JobSpy/Indeed's own
  query syntax first (`NOT word` → `-word`, implicit `AND` via spaces, `OR` kept as-is) — see
  `toScraperTerm()` in `docs/assets/app.js` — so the raw `AND`/`OR`/`NOT` keywords themselves
  never reach `search_term`.

### Triggering a new scrape from the page

GitHub Pages is static hosting — it can't run server code or hold a secret safely, so the **Run
New Search** button and saved-jobs storage go through Supabase instead: you create an account
with a username and password (Supabase Auth), saved jobs are stored in Supabase Postgres behind
Row Level Security, and clicking the button calls a Supabase Edge Function
([`supabase/functions/trigger-scrape`](supabase/functions/trigger-scrape/index.ts)) which holds
one GitHub bot token server-side and calls `workflow_dispatch` on your behalf — that bot token
is unrelated to how users log into the site. No individual user needs their own token.

`.github/workflows/scrape-jobs.yml` runs every Monday at 06:00 UTC regardless, and also accepts
all of the above as `workflow_dispatch` inputs if you'd rather trigger it from the Actions tab
by hand. Either way it executes the notebook, converts the resulting CSV into
`docs/data/jobs.json` via `scraper/csv_to_json.py`, and commits the update — which also becomes
the config used by the next scheduled run.

**Enabling Pages:** in the repo settings, set *Pages → Source* to the `docs/` folder on this
branch. Once enabled, the site updates automatically after every scrape commit.
